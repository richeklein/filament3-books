# FilamentPHP 3 Documentation Books

## About
This repository includes a single page HTML and an ePub formatted version of the [FilamentPHP documentation](https://filamentphp.com/docs).

You might be thinking ... "why the ?*%# would you do this?"ðŸ˜†. I wanted to read and search the documentation on my computer while traveling â€” without an Internet connection. I shared it just in case someone else might find it useful.

## Included packages
I did not include every package from the [FilamentPHP documentation](https://filamentphp.com/docs), since the files were getting quite large. The books include the following packages:
- Panels
- Tables
- Forms
- Actions
- Infolists
- Widgets
- Notifications
